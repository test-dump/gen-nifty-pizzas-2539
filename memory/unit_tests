Follow these steps to create a simple "Hello, World!" console application in C#.

1. Open up Visual Studio and select "Create a new project" option.

2. In the new project dialog box, select "Console App (.NET Core)" under the "C# " section and then click "Next".

3. In the next dialog box, type "HelloWorld" in the "Project name" field and then click "Create".

4. Visual Studio will create a new C# console project. The ConsoleApp.cs file should be open showing the default code.

5. Replace the code in the Program.cs class with the following:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

6. Press Ctrl+F5 to run the program.

7. A Console window appears that displays the string "Hello, World!".

Congratulations! You have just created and executed your first C# program.
